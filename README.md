**Chuzr** is a social ranking application where users give opinions on products, 
ideas, businesses, sports teams, restaurants, celebrities, and other such things,
by voting, ranking, rating, or tagging.  Users can gain reputation for their 
actions, and acquire coupons and random prizes.  Users can login via facebook or twitter, 
and even post their activities and rewards to these social networks.  

This project consists of three parts:

  * a server with a RESTful API usable by client apps
  * an ingestion system where feeds are taken in from various providers and moved into a data store
  * a subsystem that performs offline analysis of user activity to process user opinions, providing reports useful to marketing or advertising agencies.

In addition, we've included prototypical clients for the web, iOS, and android.
