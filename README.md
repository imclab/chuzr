**Chuzr** is a social ranking application where users give opinions on products, ideas, or
similar things, by voting, ranking, rating, or tagging.  Users can gain reputation for their 
actions, and acquire coupons and random prizes.  Users can login via facebook or twitter, 
and even post their activities and rewards to these social networks.  

This project consists of three parts:

  * a server for a web application (or game) for users to vote and tag
  * an ingesting system where feeds are taken in from various providers and moved into a data store
  * a subsystem that performs offline analysis of user activity to process user opinions, providing reports useful to marketing or advertising agencies.
